    ["To sing a melody in a major or minor key, without the help of an instrument you need to know how each note of the melody sounds in your mind. You can do this by using a pitch as a reference point and remembering the ‘distance’ between each note of the melody and that reference point. The best reference point is the pitch center (tonic) and one of the best methods to remember the distance of each scale degree to the tonic is through use of 2 special melodies, one for major keys and one for minor keys, in 3 stages explained below:",
    "First you have to memorize these special melodies that we call 'the major key centricity formula’ and ‘the minor key centricity formula’. These melodies strongly establishes the pitch center in your mind and more importantly helps you remember the distance between the different scale degrees and the tonic, by moving from each scale degree towards the tonic in stepwise motion from the closest possible way. You have to listen to these melodies, learn how they sound, and sing them back with solfege syllables many times until you can sing them correctly with confidence. Work on them separately and start with the major key formula. This may take a few days to a few weeks to master.",
    "For the second stage of the work, you will use your memory of these centricity formulas to recall fragments of them separately. The goal is to get to a point where you can sing these fragments, using solfege syllables, in a random order with confidence. If you can do this it means that you can leap to any scale degree at your will, although for now as the first note of these melodic fragments. Again, work on major and minor keys separately and start with major keys. This stage may take a few weeks to a few months to master.",
    "For the third stage, you will use the skill you have developed in the second stage to sing a random melody spanning from a 4th above to a 4th below the tonic, using solfege syllables. For each note of the melody you sing the corresponding fragment of its ‘centricity formula’, with the first note loud and the rest of the fragment very soft. You eventually try to only sing the first note of each fragment and hear the rest in your mind. Before singing any new melody, do not forget to mentally establish the tonality by singing its regular ‘centricity formula’.",
    "For the fourth and final stage, you will expand the skills developed so far to sing a random melody spanning around the tonic in two octaves. If the melodic note is within a 4th above and below the bottom tonic you sing it as a part of the ‘centricity formula’ around the bottom tonic, and if its within a 4th above and below the top tonic you sing it as a part of the ‘centricity formula’ around the top tonic. Sometime for a few of the highest and lowest notes you may have to shift the centricity formula in your mind to an extra octave higher or lower.",
    "This method specifically prepares you for the leaps in a melodic line, which are the most challenging parts of a melody. Of course, if you practice singing scales you can easily sing parts of a melody that move in stepwise motion without thinking too much about the distance of each note the tonic. The combination of both these skills (singing leaps and scalar motion) will allow you to sing any tonal diatonic melody with ease and confidence. ",
    "Be patient, practice, and enjoy the new abilities you will gradually develop.",
    "Why is this method of ear training effective for tonal music? ",
    "To answer this question we have to first remind ourselves of what tonal music is: Tonal music is based on a tonal system of pitches, like a major key, and the best analogy I have for a tonal system is a planetary system, where the tonic is like the sun, in a way in the center of the pitch collection, sitting stable, with a strong ‘gravitational force’. Because of its stability, tonic is perceptually the easiest pitch to find in a tonal system and therefore a very good point of reference. Going back to the initial question, the effectiveness of this method of ear training is in its use of the ‘centricity formula’ which uses this point of reference and combines it with the other important characteristic of a tonal system, the ‘gravity of tonic’, to outline the ‘distance’ of each scale degree to the tonic. ",
    "<br>Does it make sense to use the ‘movable do’ naming system for ear training?",
    "Some musicians believe in a fixed do naming system for the pitches, and are against the ‘movable do’ method, where ‘do’ is always the tonic. Although I understand the concerns of these people, I believe in using the ‘movable do’ or another similar naming system for ear training for the following reason: as all major diatonic collections follow the same intervallic structure and have the same aural qualities, it only makes sense to use this similarity when we are training our ears, and therefore it makes sense to give the same name to the same scale-degrees in different keys. Now, this set of names could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or do, re, mi, fa, so, la ti. Considering that another fixed naming system already exists for pitches, the ‘letter name’ system, I am not too worried about using ‘movable do’, and I prefer it over numbers because each name is only one syllable and it ends with a vowel.",
    //rhythm notes//
    "To read a rhythmic line you need to know how it sounds in your mind. You can do this by memorizing the sound of a few common rhythmic combinations (rhythmic cells) and putting them together. Here we focus on simple time with quarter-note and half-note as the beat value.",
    "For simple time with quarter-note as the beat value, each rhythmic cell is equal to a quarter-note in duration and the whole collection of cells covers most of the common combinations. First select the first cell, create a rhythmic line with it and listen to it being repeated on each beat. Your goal is to memorize how it sounds. Then keep a steady beat by tapping on a table and vocalize this cell, repeating it on each beat. After you feel confident about it, move on to the next cell and repeat the same process. Do this for all of them. As you are learning these rhythmic cells you can create and vocalize rhythmic lines made of multiple different cells you have practiced put in random orders. It may take a few months to master the whole collection.",
    "The practicing process is the same for simple time with half-note as the beat value. The only difference is that in this case each rhythmic cell is equal to a half-note in duration. As you are practicing, you have to keep in mind that half-note (and not quarter-note!) is the beat value and that you have to tap half-notes (and not quarter-notes!). Notice that these rhythmic cells are exactly the same as the rhythmic cells of the quarter-note collection except that all the durations are doubled!",
